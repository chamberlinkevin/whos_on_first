# Who's on First? Chatbot

This is a simple Python chatbot that mimics the famous "Who's on First?" comedy routine by Abbott & Costello. The chatbot runs in the terminal and responds to user inputs with appropriate lines from the routine.

## History of Abbott & Costello and "Who's on First?"

Abbott and Costello were an American comedy duo composed of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, whose work in radio, film, and television made them one of the most popular and beloved comedy teams of the 1940s and early 1950s. 

### The Routine

"Who's on First?" is their most famous comedy routine and is considered one of the greatest and most enduring bits in the history of comedy. The sketch is a classic example of wordplay and misunderstanding, revolving around the confusion of names of players on a fictional baseball team. 

The routine was first performed as part of their stage act in the late 1930s. It was later made famous through their radio broadcasts, most notably on "The Kate Smith Hour" in 1938, and on their television appearances, including the first episode of "The Abbott and Costello Show" in 1952. The routine has been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame and remains a staple in American pop culture.
